Version 0.9.1b
-----------

    - Initial version.
    2015-01-20:
    Project name changed to "pogo," since "boing" was already in use in the PyPI.
    
Version 0.9.2b
-----------

	2015-01-20
	Added elasticsearch to 'install_requires' directive in setup.py
	
Version 0.9.2.1b
-----------
	2015-01-20
	Bugfix -- module name "boing" had been retained in local_db_access
	in initialize_database()

Version 0.9.2.2b
-----------
	2015-01-21
	Added default logrotate configuration
	
Version 0.9.3.0b
-----------
	2015-01-21
	* Changed geoip lookup to use python-geoip and python-geolite2 instead of GeoIP,
	in order to simplify installation.
	* Minor changes in setup.py.
	* Removed obsolete comment blocks.
	
Version 0.9.3.1b
-----------
	2015-01-22
	* Removed stray references to GeoIP (old geo information library no longer used)
	
Version 0.9.3.2b
-----------
	2015-01-22
	* Removed one more import GeoIP statement from stretch_file.py
	* Modified TestDao.py to use util.get_geo_info()

Version 0.9.3.3b
-----------
	2015-01-22
	* Squashed bug in util.PogoGeoIP.__init__()
	
Version 0.9.3.4b
-----------
	2015-01-22
	* Modified util.get_geo_info() and util.PogoGeoIP to handle failure
	of geolite2.lookup() gracefully.
	
Version 0.9.3.5
-----------
	2015-02-08
	* Added an Elasticsearch timeout to the config file and modified
	record_dao_es.py to use that timeout.
	
Version 0.9.3.5b
-----------
	2015-02-08
	* Modified record_dao_es.py to work around a problem found in
	some versions of urllib3. It seems that urllib3 doesn't always
	like numerical parameters passed as strings, so Pogo's code
	was changed to use integers for port and timeout numbers.

Version 0.9.3.7
-----------
	2015-02-08
	* The fix in the last change did not work. Trying the numbers
	as floats instead.
	2015-02-09
	* The float fix worked once I figured out the correct syntax to
	use in the Elasticsearch() constructor call!
	* Removed unused modules 'python-geoip' and 'elasticutils' from
	setup.py's install_requires. Now using 'python-geoip-geolite2'
	and 'elasticsearch' instead.
	* Updated README.rst - added es_timeout parameter to config description.

Version 0.9.3.8
-----------
	2015-02-09
	* I may have finally fixed the formatting of the parameters in
	the call to Elasticsearch() in record_dao_es.py.
	* Removed obsolete call to import elasticutils in record_dao_es.py
