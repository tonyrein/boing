==================================================================
boing: Boing is a utility for putting data generated by a HonSSH honeypot into an Elasticsearch database.
==================================================================

WHAT IT DOES
------------
Boing parses the data files generated by HonSSH and inserts the information into an Elasticsearch
database. It NOT does set up the Elasticsearch server for you -- it's assumed you've already done that
or are about to do so; otherwise, this tool isn't much good to you.

Boing is strictly a "back-end" tool; it doesn't help you at all with displaying the information your
HonSSH instances generate, but only puts the information into Elasticsearch. 

When Boing runs, it checks the directories specified in its configuration file (see below) for
data files. It ignores any that are from the current day - any older ones are processed. Once
they're processed, they're collected into archive files (tarred and bzipped by default) and then
the originals are deleted. You should remove older archive files from time to time to avoid filling
up your disk.

The normal way to use Boing is to run it from a cron job, although you can run it manually if desired. In
its default configuration, it does need root privileges, since it's writing to directories it doesn't own.

You must install Boing separately on each HonSSH host for which you want the data processed. (See
below for installation information.) 


Note: This README has to be written using `reStructured Text <http://docutils.sourceforge.net/rst.html>`_, otherwise PyPi won't format it properly.

Installation
------------

The easiest way to install most Python packages is via ``easy_install`` or ``pip``::

    $ easy_install boing or pip install boing
    
You will probably have to do this with "sudo" or as root.

The default installation installs:
	* /usr/local/bin/boing	- the executable
	* /etc/boing.cfg		- the default configuration file
	* /usr/local/lib/python-2.7/dist-packages/boing 	- the Python libraries
	* /usr/local/lib/python-2.7/dist-packages/boing-<VERSION>.egg-info -- metadata about the package

If you want to install to different locations, see the help pages for pip or easy_install.

Usage
-----

As stated earlier, Boing normally runs via a cron job. As root, edit your crontab to add
a call to Boing at the intervals you desire. For example, if you want to run it every
morning at 3:05, you would do (as root):
	# crontab -e
	
	This will open your crontab file in the default text editor. Add the following line at
	the end of the file:
	5 3 * * * /usr/local/bin/boing
	
	Save the file and exit from the editor.
	
To run the file manually, execute (as root):
	 # boing
	 
	 There are no command line arguments -- everything that can be changed is changed by
	 editing the configuration file (see below).

Configuration File
------------------

When boing runs, it looks for a file called "boing.cfg;" if it's found, boing reads its configuration from there,
otherwise it uses default settings.

The default location for boing.cfg is in the /etc directory, and the installation should copy the
default configuration file to that location. Before running boing for the first time, please look
at /etc/boing.cfg and change any settings to match your environment. In particular, you will probably need
to specify the hostname or IP address of your Elasticsearch server. Also, the first time or two that
you run the program, you may want to set the logging level to INFO to display more information. (After
you're satisfied that boing is running properly, you'll probably want to set it back to WARNING to save
disk space.)

If the program can't find boing.db in /etc, it will then look in the following locations, in this order:
	* /etc/default
	* /etc/boing
	* /usr/local/share/boin
	* ~/.config/boing/ ("~" means the home directory of the user [probably root] running Boing.)
	* The directory the program was started from

If you move boing.cfg from /etc, please move it to one of these locations, or edit the file util/config.py,
one of the library files installed as part of Boing.

Here is an explanation of the configuration file contents; the settings below
are the defaults.

[main]
debug=0

debug can be 0 or 1; however, this setting isn't used at present.

[locations]
top_dir=/opt/honssh
log_dir=%(top_dir)s/logs
attempt_dir=%(top_dir)s/logs
session_dir=%(top_dir)s/sessions
archive_dir = %(top_dir)s/archives

The [locations] section specifies where the program should look for the various types
of data files generated by HonSSH, and also where the archived files should be stored.
By the way, "attempt" refers to the user name, password, and other information associated
with an intruder trying to log in.

The locations by default are relative to "top_dir," which is the root of the HonSSH installation.


[db_connection]
type=sqlite
sqlite_dir=/usr/local/share/boing/db
name=%(sqlite_dir)s/boing.db
host=''
port=''
user=''
password=''

The [db_connection] section tells boing how to connect to the database. NOTE: The database
referred to here is NOT your Elasticsearch database, but another one used for temporary
storage during processing of the HonSSH-generated files.

As of now, the only database type supported is sqlite3, and no host, port, user, or
password settings are needed for that; only the directory and data file name. When
boing runs, it checks to see if the database file named in this configuration exists,
and creates and initializes it if not. If you want your sqlite3 file to be something
other than /usr/local/share/boing/db/boing.db, specify it here.


[elasticsearch]
es_host=localhost
es_port=9200
es_index=hon_ssh

Change the information in this section to be the hostname or IP address and port of your
Elasticsearch database, and change the es_index setting if you want to use something
other than the default.

[logging]
level=WARNING
filename=/var/log/boing.log

The default logging level will generate very little output as long as things are going right.
For more detailed logging, change this to INFO, DEBUG for even more verbose output.
